Team Elevate's Yocto Build
==========================
This is Intel's Yocto build for the Intel Edison. We are using the Edison for a quadcopter project at the University of
Michigan (EECS 473).

Currently based off Version 68.

All of our changes (except for a .gitignore and this README) will be in the elevate branch

Setup Instructions
==================
1. We use bluetooth which is currently blocked on boot to fix this run
$edison> rfkill unblock bluetooth

2. libmraa (used to talk over I2C, SPI, GPIO...) is an old version which was giving us issues with our I2C interface. To
fix this use opkg to update mraa.
$edison> echo "src maa-upm http://iotdk.intel.com/repos/1.1/intelgalactic" > /etc/opkg/intel-iotdk.conf
$edison> opkg update
$edison> opkg upgrade
