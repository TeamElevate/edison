MQTT stands for MQ Telemetry Transport. It is a publish/subscribe extremely simple and lightweight messaging protocol
designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks. The design principles are to
minimize network bandwidth and device resource requirements whilst also attempting to ensure reliability and some degree
of assurance of delivery. These principles make the protocol ideal of the emerging “machine-to-machine” (M2M)
or “Internet of Things” world of connected devices, and for mobile applications, where bandwidth and battery power are at a premium.

This documentation is about asynchronous implementation of MQTT pattern publish-subscribe.
