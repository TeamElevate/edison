ZeroMQ is a high-performance asynchronous messaging library aimed at use in scalable distributed or concurrent applications.
It provides a message queue, but unlike message-oriented middleware, a ZeroMQ system can run without a dedicated message broker.
The library is designed to have a familiar socket-style API.

ZeroMQ publish/subscribe pattern connects a set of publishers to a set of subscribers. This is a data distribution pattern.
