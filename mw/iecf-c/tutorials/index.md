[Start Here](@ref start-here.md) to begin developing applications and plugins that use the iotkit-comm connectivity library. Otherwise, continue
reading to learn more.

iotkit-comm allows network-connected devices to conveniently discover and communicate with each other and the cloud. More specifically,
the iotkit-comm library enables developers to write distributed applications composed of clients, servers, and peers (both client and
server in one). It was designed primarily for the IntelÂ® Edison platform, but works just as well on other platforms. The iotkit-comm
is a library that comes in two flavors: C and node.js. This documentation focuses on the C version of the library.
